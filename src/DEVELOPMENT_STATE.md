# Development State 🚧

## Phase Progress

### ✅ Phase 1: Project Planning and Requirement Gathering
- ✅ README.md created with project overview
- ✅ DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md (this file) established
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md initialized
- ✅ Folder structure implemented

### ✅ Phase 2: Development Environment Setup
- ✅ config/sheetsConfig.js implemented
- ✅ utils/logger.js created
- ✅ utils/constants.js established
- ✅ Basic project structure tested  
- Confirm sheetsConfig.js: Stores Sheets-related settings.
- Confirm apiConfig.js: Placeholder for Discord API configuration.
- Confirm logger.js: has Basic logging utility.
- Confirm constants.js: Global constants for reusable values.

### 🔄 Phase 3: Placeholder for Discord API Integration
- ✅ Basic integration structure defined
- 🔄 Mock data structure in progress
- ⏳ Placeholder API functions pending
- ⏳ Build mockDiscordApi.js # Mock data for simulating Discord messages
- ⏳ Build discordIntegration.js # placeholder created
- ⏳ Build discordIntegration.test.js: Unit tests for placeholder functions using mock data.
- ⏳ Integration testing not begin until Phase 6-7 


### Current Focus
We are currently transitioning from Phase 2 to Phase 3, with these immediate priorities:
1. Complete Discord API placeholder module
2. Allow downstream development and testing
3. Create unit tests, use inline mocks in test file
4. Build placeholder file discordIntegration.js with these functions:
    - fetchMessages(channelId, limit): Returns mock data instead of calling the real API.
    - processAttachments(message): Simulates extracting URLs from attachments.

## Next Steps
1. Make sure these from Phase 2 are complete:
    -sheetsConfig.js: Stores Sheets-related settings.
    - apiConfig.js: Placeholder for Discord API configuration.
    - logger.js: Basic logging utility.
    - constants.js: Global constants for reusable values.
2. Complete Discord API placeholder functions

## Known Gaps
1. Placeholder Module should simulate fetching messages with hardcoded mock data
2. Placeholder to provide mock results consistent with the expected data structure of the live API.
3. Discord API placeholder functions not implemented
4. Getting good Mock data for simulating Discord messages

## Dependencies Ready
- ✅ Sheet configuration
- ✅ Basic utility functions
- ✅ Logging system
- ✅ Project structure

## Upcoming Challenges
1. Ensuring mock data accurately represents Discord API responses
2. Maintaining separation between placeholder and final implementation
3. Creating comprehensive test coverage
4. Implementing proper inline error handling

## Notes
- Current focus is on establishing solid foundations for future phases
- Maintaining modularity for easy transition to real Discord API
- Ensuring thorough documentation throughout development
