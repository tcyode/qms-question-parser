ğŸ’¡ **Overall Testing Structure:**  
`sample-data/` = Your test ingredients  
`unit-tests/`  = Testing individual components  
`integration-tests/` = Testing the whole system

ğŸ’¡ **How It All Works Together:**
1. Use `sample-data/` to provide test cases
2. Run `unit-tests/` on individual functions
3. Perform `integration-tests/` on the whole system
